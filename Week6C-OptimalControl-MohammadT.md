## Main Body

### Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) serve as indispensable tools in ensuring the safety of dynamical systems by enforcing constraints and averting the system from entering unsafe regions. These functions act as safety nets, maintaining the system within predefined boundaries and mitigating the risk of undesirable outcomes.

Mathematically, h(x) must adhere to the inequality:

$$ \ \frac{d}{dt}h(x) \leq \alpha(h(x)) + \beta(u) \ $$

#### Example:

Consider a scenario involving a quadcopter drone navigating within a constrained indoor environment. Here, the CBF h(x) could be defined to ensure that the distance between the drone and any obstacle remains above a certain threshold. Should the drone approach too close to an obstacle, the CBF would enact corrective actions, adjusting control inputs such as velocity or orientation to steer the drone away and maintain a safe distance. Thus, CBFs effectively serve as safety mechanisms, averting collisions and ensuring the secure operation of autonomous systems.

### Principle of Optimality

The Principle of Optimality states that making the best decisions at each step leads to an optimal overall outcome. In the context of dynamic programming, this principle is captured by the Bellman equation:

$$ V(x) = \min_u \{ L(x,u) + V(f(x,u)) \} $$

where V(x) is the value function representing the best expected outcome from state x, L(x,u) is the immediate cost of taking action u in state x, and f(x,u) is the transition function that defines the next state given the current state and action.

This equation essentially says that the optimal value of being in state x is the minimum cost achievable by taking any action u in that state, plus the expected value of being in the resulting state f(x,u). By recursively applying this principle, we can compute the optimal value function for the entire system.


#### Example:

Consider a robotic entity traversing through a grid-based environment, facing decisions at each grid cell regarding movement direction. The Bellman equation empowers the robot to discern the optimal action to undertake at each cell, weighing the immediate cost of movement against the anticipated cost of reaching the goal from the subsequent cell. By iteratively unraveling the Bellman equation, the robot can chart the optimal path to its destination, while minimizing the overall cost incurred.

### Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Control

LQR control emerges as a potent technique for stabilizing linear systems characterized by quadratic cost functions. Its primary objective revolves around minimizing a cost function subject to state space of the system where x signifies the system state, u denotes the control input, Q represents a positive definite weighting matrix for the state, and R stands as a positive definite weighting matrix for the control input.

The optimal control law for LQR control is delineated by u* = -kx wherein K denotes the solution to the associated algebraic Riccati equation:

$$ \ A^T P + PA - PB(R + B^T P B)^{-1} B^T P + Q = 0 \ $$

Once K is ascertained, it can be wielded to compute the optimal control input u* for any bestowed state x, thereby ensuring stability and optimal performance.

#### Example:

Consider an inverted pendulum system tasked with maintaining the pendulum in an upright position. LQR control calculates the optimal control input (typically a force) requisite to stabilize the pendulum around the upright orientation. By modulating the control input predicated on the prevailing state of the pendulum, LQR control adeptly upholds stability even amidst perturbations.

### HJ Reachability

HJ reachability represents a mathematical framework instrumental in analyzing safe regions within dynamical systems constrained by limits. This framework entails solving the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (PDE):

$$ \ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + H(x, \nabla V) = 0 \ $$

Here, V embodies the value function denoting the optimal cost-to-go from a conferred state, t designates time, x signifies the state vector, and nabla V encapsulates the gradient of V with respect to x. The function 
$$ \(H(x, \nabla V)\) $$
dubbed the Hamiltonian, encapsulates the system's dynamics.

By solving the HJ PDE, one can elicit the value function V(x), furnishing insights into the reachable set of the system. This set encompasses all states accessible from a given initial state while satisfying specific safety constraints.

The reachable set materializes from the level sets of the value function V, demarcating regions in the state space wherein the system can safely operate without contravening constraints.

#### Example:

Envisage an autonomous vehicle navigating through a congested environment. HJ reachability analysis can be leveraged to compute the vehicle's reachable set, factoring in obstacles and safety constraints such as minimum distance stipulations. By discerning the reachable set, one can discern safe trajectories for the vehicle to traverse, ensuring collision-free and constraint-compliant locomotion.

### Trajectory Optimization

Trajectory optimization emerges as a potent technique for identifying the optimal path for a system to traverse over time, meticulously considering its dynamics and constraints. Prevalent in robotics, aerospace, and autonomous systems, trajectory optimization engenders the formulation of smooth and efficient motion trajectories.

Mathematically, trajectory optimization endeavors to minimize a cost function of the form:

$$ \ \int_{t_0}^{t_f} L(x(t), u(t)) dt \ $$

Trajectory optimization strives to pinpoint the optimal trajectory that minimizes the cost function while upholding the system's dynamics and constraints. This necessitates solving a formidable optimization problem, often replete with nonlinear dynamics, non-convex cost functions, and intricate constraints.

#### Example:

Ponder a quadcopter drone tasked with navigating through a cluttered environment to a designated target location while evading obstacles. Trajectory optimization can be harnessed to chart a seamless and collision-free path for the drone by optimizing its trajectory over time. By cognizantly considering the drone's dynamics, environmental constraints, and mission objectives, trajectory optimization guarantees the drone's safe and efficient navigation to its destination.
